# üîí Advanced Network ACL Configuration (Cisco Packet Tracer Lab)

This project demonstrates the configuration of **Extended Access Control Lists (ACLs)** in a simulated enterprise network using **Cisco Packet Tracer**. The lab enforces selective traffic filtering based on IP addresses, protocols (e.g., Telnet, TFTP, HTTP), and security policies. The goal is to simulate how real-world organizations control internal and external access to services using router-based ACLs.

## üß† Objective

Design and configure a routed network to:
- Implement **extended ACLs** for filtering traffic
- Allow/deny based on **source/destination IPs and ports**
- Secure access to internal servers
- Block unauthorized access from external users

---

## üñ•Ô∏è Network Topology

The lab topology includes:
- 3 routers (R1, R2, R3)
- 1 ISP router
- 4 internal PCs (PC1‚ÄìPC4)
- 2 servers: Web/TFTP Server and Public Web Server
- 1 external host (simulated attacker)

## üîß ACL Requirements & Configuration

### ‚úÖ Task 1: Routing & Connectivity
- Configured **EIGRP** between all routers
- Verified full reachability using `ping` and routing tables

---

### üö´ Task 2: Block Telnet from 192.168.10.0/24
```bash
access-list 100 deny tcp 192.168.10.0 0.0.0.255 any eq 23
access-list 100 permit ip any any

```

### üîê Task 3: Allow TFTP and HTTP from 192.168.30.0/24
```bash
access-list 110 permit udp 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 host 192.168.20.254 eq 69
access-list 110 permit tcp 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 host 209.165.201.30 eq 80
access-list 110 deny ip 192.168.30.0 0.0.0.255 any

```

### üåê Task 4: Allow Web Access from Outside Host Only
```bash
access-list 120 permit tcp host 209.165.202.156 host 209.165.201.30 eq 80
access-list 120 deny ip host 209.165.202.156 any

```

## üß™ Tools & Skills Demonstrated
-Cisco Packet Tracer
-Extended ACL syntax and placement
-IP subnetting and interface configuration
-Dynamic routing with EIGRP
-Simulating traffic and validation with ping & telnet

## ‚úÖ Outcome
-This project successfully showcases how to:
-Enforce traffic segmentation
-Restrict service-level access
-Implement firewall-like policies using router ACLs
-It replicates core functions of perimeter firewalls, useful in both small enterprise and academic networks.
